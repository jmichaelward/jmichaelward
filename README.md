### Hello!

I'm Jeremy. 

I used to have a whole write-up here about myself, projects I'm working on, and other things, but there's been so much upheaval over the past several years that it's hard to pick out the
relevant parts right now. So, consider this a placeholder until I figure out better ways and/or reasons to market myself on my GitHub repository.

In the meantime, here are some basic things about me:
- I work as a software engineer for a living, which is why I have a GitHub profile to begin with
- I play the drums, and as of December 2022, am actively playing live shows in the Twin Cities
- My hobbies and interests include board games, pinball, reading, bicycling, attending live music and comedy events. 
- I got into knitting for spell during the pandemic

On the coding side, I've been working with web languages since the mid-2000s, but professionally since 2013. Currently, I spend my days building out web applications atop the Laravel framework,
so near-term, most of my extracurricular efforts are focused there. I've been hobby programming less frequently of late, but when I do, I typically push things up to GitHub when I'm playing
around with a new language, framework, or library, and want to better understand how it works, becuase I think it's better to learn in public. 

That's about it for now. During the upcoming winter break, I'm planning on rebuilding my personal website, and perhaps I'll have more to say then.
