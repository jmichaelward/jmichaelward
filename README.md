### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

I'm a Software Engineer from St. Paul, MN. Since 2013, I've worked at a small handful of web development agencies and product companies. My primary passions are software architecture and building tools that enhance the development experience, and though the main focus of my career to date has been in the WordPress 
ecosystem, I frequently study other languages and frameworks in order to satisfy my curiosity for tinkering.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy playing board games and video games, biking around the neighborhood, and spending time with my friends and loved ones.

### What I'm Working On

As I mentioned, I tinker a lot with languages and frameworks, and frequently start small side projects to enhance my own development experience. A few projects
that I'm particularly proud of and/or that I still use all the time are the [OOPS-WP](https://github.com/webdevstudios/oops-wp) library to bring more object-oriented thinking to WordPress, my [wp-starter](https://github.com/jmichaelward/wp-starter) package that I use to quickly spin up local WordPress sites, and
[Dudley](https://github.com/jmichaelward/dudley), a components framework I used to import UI structures that were commonly re-used across site builds. 

In addition to those past projects, I'm also currently tinkering with:

- [Into the Void](https://github.com/jmichaelward/into-the-void) - a WordPress API-based micro-blogging plugin, the primary goal of which is for me to develop an iOS client using Apple's Swift language.
- [Order Up](https://github.com/jmichaelward/bga-orderup) - a Board Game Arena implementation of a game designed by my friend, Ryan Harris.
- [learn-node](https://github.com/jmichaelward/learn-node) - a landing spot for my code commits as I dig into learning how to build apps with Node.js.

### What I Want To Learn

My background is primarily in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so I'm comfortable with the syntax and many of the tools and frameworks that have emerged for those
languages over the years.

I'm a big fan of the [Web Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap), which is updated and maintained by Kamran Ahmed. It's got a lot
of useful ideas for what to dig into next if I'm unsure about what I need to know or need ideas about what to be curious about.

Otherwise, if you dig through [my repositories](https://github.com/jmichaelward?tab=repositories), you'll see some public examples of my interests,
including Python, Node, React, Docker, Bash, and more.

Having worked with WordPress for so many years, and gaining continually more comfortable with the ecosystem in my day-to-day, I'm extremely passionate about dev tooling and figuring out ways to make redundant tasks more enjoyable. Therefore, I'm also excited to learn about CLI tools, software architecture, and approaches to problem solving that help me reshape the way I think. In the spring of 2021, I began participating in the [Dev Book Club](https://devbookclub.org), where we read 
[Refactoring: 2nd Edition](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler.

### Want to Work on Something Together?

Interested in collaborating? I'm particularly interested in contributing to open-source projects that meet a need for the broader community, and especially if it's something that enables me to learn new skills. Drop me a line via one of the links below!

### Links

Most of what you need to find me are already on the sidebar here, but just for the sake of completeness, here are some other places online where you can find me:

- [My website](https://jmichaelward.com), where I write semi-frequently about development-related topics.
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jmichaelward), where I'm slowly getting acclimated to live coding, but also play a bunch of Rocket League.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jmichaelward), where I attempt a mix of trying to be funny, sharing useful tech links, and yelling at clouds.
