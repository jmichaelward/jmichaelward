### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

I'm a Software Engineer from St. Paul, MN. I spend my days at [Rocketgenius](https://rocketgenius.com), where I work alongside my amazing colleagues on
the product team developing [Gravity Forms](https://gravityforms.com) and its extensive suite of third-party integrations. At night, when I'm not playing 
some kind of game, I'm either dreaming up or working on some kind of side project, trying to learn a new programming language or framework, or catching up with
my friends online over Zoom or in person in a backyard or patio.

### What I'm Working On

During the day, all things Gravity Forms! 

The rest of the time, I start small personal projects to explore a passion, an idea, a technique, a framework, or a new language altogether. Though the vast 
majority of my work to date has been in the WordPress sphere, I keep on top of broader trends and tools in the PHP and JavaScript communities, and I tinker a lot
other languages and frameworks.

Pinned below are some samples of some of those ideas. In addition to these past highlights, I'm also currently working on:

- [GF Structures](https://github.com/jmichaelward/gf-structures) - an object-based library for Gravity Forms add-on development.
- [Into the Void](https://github.com/jmichaelward/into-the-void) - a WordPress API-based micro-blogging plugin, the primary goal of which is for me to develop an iOS client using Apple's Swift language.
- [Order Up](https://github.com/jmichaelward/bga-orderup) - a Board Game Arena implementation of a game designed by my friend, Ryan Harris.

### What I Want To Learn

My background is primarily in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so I'm comfortable with the syntax and many of the tools and frameworks that have emerged for those
languages over the years.

I'm a big fan of the [Web Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap), which is updated and maintained by Kamran Ahmed. It's got a lot of
useful ideas for what to dig into next if I'm unsure about what I need to know or need ideas about what to be curious about.

Otherwise, if you dig through [my repositories](https://github.com/jmichaelward?tab=repositories), you'll see some public examples of my interests, including Python, Node, React, Docker, Bash, and more.

Having worked with WordPress for so many years, and gaining continually more comfortable with the ecosystem in my day-to-day, I'm extremely passionate about dev tooling and figuring out ways to make redundant tasks more enjoyable. Therefore, I'm also excited to learn about CLI tools, software architecture, and approaches to problem solving that help me reshape the way I think. In the spring of 2021, I began participating in the [Dev Book Club](https://devbookclub.org), where we read 
[Refactoring: 2nd Edition](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler.

### Want to Work on Something Together?

Interested in collaborating? I'm particularly interested in contributing to open-source projects that meet a need for the broader community, and especially if it's 
something that enables me to learn new skills. Drop me a line via one of the links below!

### Links

Most of what you need to find me are already on the sidebar here, but just for the sake of completeness, here are some other places online where you can find me:

- [My website](https://jmichaelward.com), where I write semi-frequently about development-related topics.
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jmichaelward), where I'm slowly getting acclimated to live coding, but also play a bunch of Rocket League.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jmichaelward), where I attempt a mix of trying to be funny, sharing useful tech links, and yelling at clouds.
